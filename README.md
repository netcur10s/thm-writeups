# THM Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups and notes from Try Hack Me (THM) challenges.  
I use these exercises to practice **enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and detection thinking** — skills directly applicable to a SOC Analyst / Blue Team role.  

> ⚠️ All content is for **educational purposes only**. These writeups are based on retired HTB boxes or lab environments that I have explicit permission to test.  

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each box has its own folder containing:
- `README.md` → Full writeup (overview, steps, and lessons learned)  
- `screenshots/` → Supporting evidence and visuals  
- `notes.md` → Optional rough notes or commands
